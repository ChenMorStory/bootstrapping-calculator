# Bootstrapping Calculator

This is a very simple spreadsheet that I used to figure out if I had enough savings before taking the plunge to [quit my job](https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/) and live off my savings while bootstrapping my own business. You can read more about my personal financial planning [on my blog](https://danielvassallo.com/from-employee-to-bootstrapper/). The instructions are in the spreadsheet.
