# Bootstrapping Calculator

This is a very simple spreadsheet that I used to figure out if I had enough savings before taking the plunge to [quit my job](https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/) and [live off my savings](https://danielvassallo.com/from-employee-to-bootstrapper/) while bootstrapping my own business. It is intentionally very simple: There are only 4 parameters, and the only one that requires guessing is the income. By tweaking that value, I could get an income target to aim for, and I was assured that my venture would survive if I meet it.
